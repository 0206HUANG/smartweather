# SmartWeather

## Project Description

**SmartWeather** is an intelligent weather alert system powered by an AI rule-based engine. Built with **Vite + React**, this application demonstrates how sensor data inputs can be processed through a rule inference engine for risk detection and decision analysis.

## Key Features

- 🌡️ **Sensor Data Input**: Input meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
- ⚠️ **Smart Risk Detection**: Automatically identify potential weather risks (flood, storm, heatwave, etc.) using a rule-based engine
- 📊 **Decision Trace**: Display the reasoning process and path cost analysis
- 🎯 **Scenario Demos**: Pre-configured demo buttons to quickly simulate different extreme weather scenarios
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various device screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3
